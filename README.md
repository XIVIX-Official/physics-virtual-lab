## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running, follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   npm, yarn, or pnpm

### Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repo**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/XIVIX-Official/physics-virtual-lab.git
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the project directory**
    ```sh
    cd physics-virtual-lab
    ```
3.  **Install NPM packages**
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Set up the Gemini API Key**
    The AI Tutor requires a Google Gemini API key to function. Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your API key:
    ```
    VITE_API_KEY=YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY
    ```
    The application is configured to securely access this key.

5.  **Run the development server**
    ```sh
    npm run dev
    ```
    This will start the Vite development server, typically on `http://localhost:5173`. Open this URL in your browser to see the application.
